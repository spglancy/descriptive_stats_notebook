    "Exploring the mathematical relationships in data can help us uncover invaluable insights about aspects of the world the data is describing. In this lesson we will explore some of the fundamental data relationships that can be calculated. These relationships include variance, percentile, correlation, and covariance. We will explore what each of these mean, how they are calculated, and apply them to a real dataset."

Some examples of data variables that you may be familiar with are things such as age, cost, temperature etc. Datasets consist of a number of observed values of several different variables."

    "Correlation is broadly defined as the statistical relationship between two variables. There are a number of reasons why different variables could be correlated. It is important to keep in mind that correlation does not equal causation. Two variables being correlated does not necessarily mean that one is caused by the other, it may be the case that these varaibles could both depend on a third unknown variable. All correlation tells us is that there is some sort of relationship present which can help us make predictions about future behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe some correlations in terms of how variables change. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a positve correlation is present, both variables will change in the same direction. If the value of one variable increases then the value of the other variable will also increase. They will also decrese together as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a neutral correlation is present there is no measureable relationship when the variables change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a negative correlation is present, then when one variables goes up the other will go down and vice versa.\n",
